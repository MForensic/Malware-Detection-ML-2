# Malware-Detection-ML-2


MainVol.py: Is used to call volatility plugins to be executed over given memory image Where it generates output in text format(except psxview which is in excel format). The output file name is combination of plugin name and memory image name. For example apihooksevilprofessor.vmem.text is output for apihooks plugin for evilprofessor.vmem .

psxview.py, msghook.py, malfind.py, ehook.py, api.py: Each python script takes respective output of MainVol.py as their input (api.py will take apihooksevilprofessor.vmem.text and malfind.py will take malfindarustok.vmem.text as input so on.) and will clean them, encode them (convert values into 0 and 1). The output of each of these scripts is in excel format following the same naming convention described above.

Merge.py: is used to merge all the different outputs from previous scripts into a single file.

meta_file.py: is used to create Bunch object from single file generated by Merge.py. Bunch is Dictionary-like object, the containing attributes like: ‘data’, the data to learn, ‘target’, the classification labels, ‘target_names’, the meaning of the labels, ‘feature_names’, the meaning of the features, and ‘DESCR’, the full description of the dataset.

dtree.py: Is used to generate decision tree from training dataset in Bunch, test it against test dataset in Bunch, and visualize the tree output.
